**ML Workbench** is an open source machine learning and artificial intelligence platform for Data Scientist to solve business problems faster and quicker, build prototypes and convert them to actual project. The modeler helps from data preparation to model building and deployment, the tool supports a large variety of algorithms that can be run without a single line of code. The web based tool has various components which help Data Scientist of different skill levels to perfrom several model building tasks and provides deployment ready PMML files which can be hosted as a REST services.

ML Workbench allows it's user to cover a wide variety of algorithms and Deep Neural Network architectures, with minimal or No code enviornment. It is also one of the few deep-learning platforms to support the Predictive Model Markup Languaue (PMML) format, PMML allows for different statistical and data mining tools to speak the same language.
* **AutoML** : Automatically train Machine learning models on data supports huge space of algorithms and hyper parameters tuning.
* **Model Editor** : Create Deep Neural Network models using drag and drop functionality, which supports wide variety of model layers, once model architecture is ready, train your model. Editor also comes with pre-trained architcture templates that helps in quick model building and training.
* **Jupyter Notebook** : It has integrated Jupyter Notebook (For R and Python).
* **Tensorboard** : It provides Tensorboard dashboard to show the progress of models.
* **Code Execution** : It provides support of executing Python script files for more advance requirements.
* **REST API Support** :  It has REST APIs to use as deployment tool.
